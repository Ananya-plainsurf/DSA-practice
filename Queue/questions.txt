🟢 Queue Practice Set (Interview-Oriented)
Q1. Implement Queue using Stacks

👉 You already did this ✔️
(2 stacks, amortized O(1))

Q2. First Unique Character in a Stream
Input:  a a b c b
Output: a -1 b b c


Uses:

Queue

Map

Q3. Sliding Window Maximum (VERY IMPORTANT)
nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output = [3,3,5,5,6,7]


Uses:

Deque

Queue logic + monotonic structure

Q4. Number of Recent Calls (LeetCode 933)
ping(t)
remove all < t - 3000


Pure queue thinking.

Q5. Rotting Oranges 🍊

BFS + Queue
Very common in interviews.

📌 What we’ll do next (STEP-BY-STEP)

👉 Next problem (recommended):

Number of Recent Calls

Very simple

Builds confidence

Pure queue

Say “Start Q2” or “Start Q3”
I’ll guide you exactly like we did here — no panic, no overwhelm 💙
